The completion of the review will make available SDR 63.4 million (€74.6 million) to BiH under the EFF, bringing the total funds available to SDR 126.8 million (€149.3 million). The Board also approved the extension of the EFF by 12 months and waivers  of nonobservance of the end June 2017 PC on net lending (budget balance) for the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina (IBiH) and the Federation (FBiH) central government.

Economic conditions have deteriorated rapidly as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The first review under the current Extended Arrangement (EFF, 167 percent of quota) was completed in February 2018, including a one-year extension to September 2020. The Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) authorities are requesting financial assistance
under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI), equivalent to 100 percent of quota (about €330 million), to help close the projected urgent balance of payments need, which, if not addressed, would result in immediate and severe economic disruption. This program is cancelled before the Board approved their RFI.

At R1, the authorities expressed their intention not to draw the amount available at the completion of this review. At R2, authorities and staff agreed that BOP projections assume the NBG would draw the amounts available. During R3, in view of the weaker economic and external financing prospects, the proposed augmentation (by SDR 270 million or 180 percent of quota) and extension of the SBA (to June 14, 2011) aims at facilitating an orderly exit from high public and external deficits, and the associated dependence on official financial support. R4 revealed that economic developments and the outlook for 2010 are broadly in line with the expectations of the third review. Successful program implementation has begun to produce the desired results in terms of restoring confidence and stabilizing the economy. While growth is expected to be positive in 2010, the economic recovery remains fragile. R5 revealed that economic activity picked up in the fourth quarter of 2009, but weak private capital inflows and sluggish credit growth continue to point to a slow recovery in 2010. R6 revealed, that recent global financial market turbulence has shifted the balance of risks in 2010 from domestic to external factors. R7R8 finds that with the economic recovery gaining ground, policy target for 2011 emphasized fiscal adjustment and an increase in Net International Reserves (NIR), in order to bolster the exit strategy. R9 finds that the stabilization objectives supported by the current SBA have been largely achieved. A successful Eurobond issue has eased considerably the debt service hump of 2013.

In the 13th review, the Board completed the review based on lapse-of-time procedures, without a formal meeting.
After the 13th review, the new government requested the cancellation of the EFF program and approval of a new 3-year SBA program (which was approved on 11/11/2016).",1,5,153.845,5.03594560205242,0.188524590163934,0.877049180327869,0.801,0.1255,0.0183,0.0284,2e-04,0.000556548483749401,0,NA,NA,130551,4448,0

The additional financing will help the authorities meet new balance of payments needs associated with reconstruction following Cyclone Idai. It will bring Malawi’s total access under the current arrangement to SDR 105.835 million (about US$145.3 million) equivalent to 76.25 percent of Malawi’s quota). The Executive Board also approved the authorities’ request for waivers of nonobservance of the performance criteria on the primary fiscal balance at end-December 2018 and end-June 2019.

On 10/2/2020, The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a disbursement of SDR 72.31 million (US$101.96 million or 52.1 percent of quota) to Malawi under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). This is the second emergency disbursement since the onset of the pandemic and will help finance Malawi’s urgent balance of payment and fiscal needs. It follows the Executive Board’s approval of the disbursement of SDR 66.44 million (US$91 million or 47.9 percent of quota) on May 1, 2020. The cancellation by Malawi, effective September 24, 2020, of the Extended Credit
Facility arrangement for Malawi approved on April 30, 2018

The authorities are seeking additional financial assistance under the “exogenous shock” window of the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF-2) for SDR 49.07 million (35 percent of quota), to address the external financing needs arising from the economic impact of the pandemic.

The additional request, if approved, will bring total disbursements under the RCF to 95 percent of quota in 2020, taking outstanding credit to 299 percent of quota, just within the normal cumulative access limit for the PRGT. Given the high degree of uncertainty regarding the duration and scale of the pandemic and the practical difficulties of holding comprehensive policy discussions, the authorities are cancelling the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement; this would also allow them to have a higher access under the RCF given the constraint they have under the normal cumulative access limit on 7/22/2020.

The SCF was approved at the same time as the completion of the 4th Review under the PSI.
Objectives under the SCF would match those under the PSI: enhancing fiscal and debt sustainability, reducing inflation, and resolving the power crisis to enhance growth prospects. At R1, disbursement schedule was rephased.
Press Release No. 13/45 of February 12, 2013:
The Tanzanian authorities have informed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that they have decided to draw the equivalent of SDR 74.6 million available to them under the Standby Credit Facility (SCF) arrangement.
The authorities considered this decision to be an integral part of their response to heightened external sector vulnerabilities and emerging balance of payments pressures, and expect this step to boost market confidence.
At R2, the Government intends to treat the remaining tranches of SCF only as a precautionary line of credit.
The Executive Board approved on December 12, 2013 a request by Tanzania to extend the country’s arrangement under the Standby Credit Facility (SCF) until April 30, 2014, to allow time for the third and final review.
